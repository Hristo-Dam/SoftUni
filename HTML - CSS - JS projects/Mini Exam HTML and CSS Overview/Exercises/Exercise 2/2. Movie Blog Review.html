        <h1>THE ONE AND ONLY IVAN (2020) REVIEW</h1>
        <h2>THE STORY</h2>
        <p>Mack <em>(Bryan Cranston)</em>, is the proud owner of the world's smallest circus, 
            taking his animal variety and acts to the confines of the <em>Big Top Mall</em>. Unfortunately, 
            the crowds are not as what they used to be. On the flip side, Mack's big draw is Ivan <em>(Sam Rockwell)</em>, 
            a silverback lowland gorilla who was raised by the ringmaster, growing comfortable with his part of the show, 
            which involves acting tough and roaring to tense up the spectators.
        </p>
        <p>My actual <q>first look</q> at the movie was when they (Disney) released an official 
            trailer for the project a few months ago and I do have to say that I was a little intrigued by the movie.
